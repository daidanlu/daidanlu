I build backend systems and the applications around them. My work emphasizes schema design, API contracts, and making services straightforward to deploy and operate.

- **Focus:** backend architecture, databases, API design, testable code  
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C/C++, SQL  
- **Frameworks:** Django REST Framework, Spring Boot, MyBatis  
- **Ops & tooling:** Docker, Nginx, Git, CI/CD, Bash  
- **Datastores:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, SQLite  
- **Frontend (supporting):** React, Ant Design, HTML/CSS/JS

## Ongoing Projects

### ERP Inventory & Order System _(in progress)_
A full-stack platform under **active development** for warehouse and order management.

- **Stack:** Django REST + PostgreSQL + React, Docker Compose  
- **Scope:** ~5k SKUs, 500+ orders/month; multi-role support  
- **Current focus:** stabilizing inventory linkage and audit logging, refining API contracts  
- **What Iâ€™ve contributed:** product & order schema, idempotent APIs, dockerized setup for dev/prod

### Local RAG Demo _(in progress)_
A lightweight Python demo showing the **RAG pattern** for document Q&A, designed to be easy to reproduce locally.

- **Stack:** Python, Streamlit, sentence-transformers, NumPy vector store, `llama-cpp-python`  
- **Current focus:** reproducible setup + evaluation script  
- **Design choices:** single-file index, in-memory store (sufficient for demo scale)

## How I work
- Start from schema and API contracts â†’ write failing tests â†’ iterate.  
- Prefer proven tools that are easy to operate.  
- Ship in small increments and document trade-offs.
